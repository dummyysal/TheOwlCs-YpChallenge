## Key Features

`1. Anomaly Detection`:Usage of pre-trained machine learning models to analyze network traffic and identify unusual patterns. 

`2. Predictive Analysis and Security Recommendations`: Providing insights into detected anomalies, predicting the type and severity of potential attacks.

`3. Owl Chat Assistant`: An interactive chatbot capable of answering questions about cybersecurity tactics (e.g., MITRE ATT&CK) and specific vulnerabilities.

##  Technology Stack

- Backend: Flask & FastAPI for creating robust APIs
- Machine Learning: Anomaly detection models (trained on the UNSW_NB15 dataset and network logs ) 
- Natural Language Processing (NLP): Provides recommendations and detailed CVE information 
- Cloud Hosting: Deployed on AWS EC2 for scalability and public accessibility
- Security & Scalability: Utilizes AWS security features to ensure a secure and scalable architecture
